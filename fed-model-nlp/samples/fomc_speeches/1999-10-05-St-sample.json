In these circumstances, the Federal Open Market Committee will need to be especially alert in the months ahead to the potential for costs to increase significantly in excess of productivity in a manner that could contribute to inflation pressures and undermine the impressive performance of the economy.\r\n", "\r\nAgainst this background, the Committee adopted a directive that was biased toward a possible firming of policy going forward.  Committee members emphasized that such a directive did not signify a commitment to near-term action.  The Committee will need to evaluate additional information on the balance of aggregate supply and demand and conditions in financial markets.  \r\n", "\n1999 Monetary policy\n"], "doc_type": "St"}, "entity_sentiments": {"productivity growth": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.04061419516801834}, "trends": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.015536579303443432}, "pool": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.009181912057101727}, "directive": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.00658003892749548}, "information": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.00507429288700223}, "firming": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.0037683930713683367}, "policy": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.003193601965904236}, "background": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.002805208321660757}}, "paragraph_count": 5, "word_count": 171, "n_gram_count": {"1": 171, "2": 170, "3": 169}, "pos_tags_count": {"noun_count": 30, "verb_count": 11, "adjective_count": 15}, "change_in_vix": null, "change_in_s_n_p_500": null}
