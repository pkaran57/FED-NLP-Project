Bernanke, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Donald L. Kohn; Dennis P. Lockhart; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen.\u00a0 Voting against was Jeffrey M. Lacker, who preferred to expand the monetary base at this time by purchasing U.S. Treasury securities rather than through targeted credit programs."], "doc_type": "St"}, "entity_sentiments": {"Federal Reserve": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.6000000238418579, "salience": 0.04725256562232971}, "production": {"score": -0.30000001192092896, "magnitude": 0.30000001192092896, "salience": 0.008676527068018913}, "back spending": {"score": -0.20000000298023224, "magnitude": 0.20000000298023224, "salience": 0.00704154884442687}, "businesses": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.006748655810952187}, "consumers": {"score": -0.30000001192092896, "magnitude": 0.30000001192092896, "salience": 0.005928628146648407}, "housing starts": {"score": -0.4000000059604645, "magnitude": 0.4000000059604645, "salience": 0.005928628146648407}, "employment": {"score": -0.20000000298023224, "magnitude": 0.20000000298023224, "salience": 0.005928628146648407}, "demand": {"score": -0.5, "magnitude": 0.5, "salience": 0.005912390537559986}, "price stability": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.004997755866497755}, "purchases": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.004173228517174721}, "quantities": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.004173228517174721}, "mortgage": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.004173228517174721}, "resumption": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.00400429405272007}, "tools": {"score": 0.20000000298023224, "magnitude": 0.20000000298023224, "salience": 0.00400429405272007}, "declines": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.003966215066611767}, "support": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.003183760680258274}, "conditions": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.001719426247291267}, "purchase program": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.0013786570634692907}, "duration": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.0012108399532735348}, "extension": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.001208544010296464}, "Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.0008130093337967992}}, "paragraph_count": 5, "word_count": 474, "n_gram_count": {"1": 474, "2": 473, "3": 472}, "pos_tags_count": {"noun_count": 77, "verb_count": 28, "adjective_count": 43}, "change_in_vix": null, "change_in_s_n_p_500": 1.1328527291452053}
