Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I. Plosser; Gary H. Stern; and Kevin M. Warsh.\u00a0 Voting against was Richard W. Fisher, who preferred an increase in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting."], "doc_type": "St"}, "entity_sentiments": {"markets": {"score": -0.4000000059604645, "magnitude": 0.4000000059604645, "salience": 0.021481255069375038}, "labor markets": {"score": -0.20000000298023224, "magnitude": 0.20000000298023224, "salience": 0.017448512837290764}, "easing": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.014940769411623478}, "stress": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.01303207129240036}, "commodities": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.011833259835839272}, "growth": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.011747285723686218}, "uncertainty": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.010883077047765255}, "energy": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.010053928010165691}, "increases": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.009931288659572601}, "state": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.008833502419292927}, "indicators": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.008833502419292927}}, "paragraph_count": 5, "word_count": 248, "n_gram_count": {"1": 248, "2": 247, "3": 246}, "pos_tags_count": {"noun_count": 47, "verb_count": 12, "adjective_count": 27}, "change_in_vix": null, "change_in_s_n_p_500": 0.06828010014414947}
