The evidence accumulated \r\n        over the intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand \r\n        at a solid rate and hiring appears to have picked up. Although incoming \r\n        inflation data have moved somewhat higher, long-term inflation expectations \r\n        appear to have remained well contained. \r\n      ", " The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment \r\n        of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. Similarly, \r\n        the risks to the goal of price stability have moved into balance. At this \r\n        juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee believes \r\n        that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be \r\n        measured.\r\n      ", " Voting for the FOMC monetary policy actions were: Alan Greenspan, Chairman; \r\n        Timothy F.
