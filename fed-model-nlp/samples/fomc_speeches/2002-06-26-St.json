{"meeting_date": "2002-06-26", "paragraphs": ["\nFor immediate release\n", "\r\nThe Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 3/4 percent. \r\n", "\r\nThe information that has become available since the last meeting of the Committee confirms that economic activity is continuing to increase. However, both the upward impetus from the swing in inventory investment and the growth in final demand appear to have moderated.  The Committee expects the rate of increase of final demand to pick up over coming quarters, supported in part by robust underlying growth in productivity, but the degree of the strengthening remains uncertain. \r\n", "\r\nIn these circumstances, although the stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative, the Committee believes that, for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals. \r\n", "\r\nVoting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, Chairman; William J.
