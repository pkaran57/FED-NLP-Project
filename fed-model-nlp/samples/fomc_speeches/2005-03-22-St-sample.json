{"fomc_doc": {"meeting_date": "2005-03-22", "paragraphs": ["\nFor immediate release\n", "The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2-3/4 percent. ", "The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.  Output evidently continues to grow at a solid pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually.  Though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident.  The rise in energy prices, however, has not notably fed through to core consumer prices. ", "The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. \r\n", "Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, Chairman;\r\nTimothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson, Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; \r\nAnthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern.", "In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 3-3/4 percent.
