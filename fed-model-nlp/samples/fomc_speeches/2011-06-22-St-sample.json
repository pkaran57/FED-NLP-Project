{"fomc_doc": {"meeting_date": "2011-06-22", "paragraphs": ["\n       Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indicates that the economic recovery is continuing at a moderate pace, though somewhat more slowly than the Committee had expected.\u00a0 Also, recent labor market indicators have been weaker than anticipated.\u00a0 The slower pace of the recovery reflects in part factors that are likely to be temporary, including the damping effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer purchasing power and spending as well as supply chain disruptions associated with the tragic events in Japan.\u00a0 Household spending and business investment in equipment and software continue to expand.\u00a0 However, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector continues to be depressed. \u00a0Inflation has picked up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods, as well as the recent supply chain disruptions.\u00a0 However, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.\n    ", "\n        Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.\u00a0   The unemployment rate remains elevated; however, the Committee expects the pace of recovery to pick up over coming quarters and the unemployment rate to resume its gradual decline toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.\u00a0     Inflation has moved up recently, but the Committee anticipates that inflation will subside to levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate. \u00a0However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.\u00a0\n    ", "\n       To promote the ongoing economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.\u00a0 The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.\u00a0 The Committee will complete its purchases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of this month and will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings.\u00a0 The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.\u00a0\n    ", "\n       The Committee will monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will act as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.\n    ", "\n       Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S.
