{"fomc_doc": {"meeting_date": "2010-06-23", "paragraphs": ["\n       Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that the economic recovery is proceeding and that the labor market is improving gradually. Household spending is increasing but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly; however, investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Housing starts remain at a depressed level. Financial conditions have become less supportive of economic growth on balance, largely reflecting developments abroad. Bank lending has continued to contract in recent months. Nonetheless, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for a time.\n    ", "\n       Prices of energy and other commodities have declined somewhat in recent months, and underlying inflation has trended lower. With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.\n    ", "\n       The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.\n    ", "\n       The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.\n    ", "\n       Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A. Duke; Donald L. Kohn; Sandra Pianalto; Eric S. Rosengren; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against the policy action was Thomas M. Hoenig, who believed that continuing to express the expectation of exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period was no longer warranted because it could lead to a build-up of future imbalances and increase risks to longer-run macroeconomic and financial stability, while limiting the Committee\u2019s flexibility to begin raising rates modestly.\n    "], "doc_type": "St"}, "entity_sentiments": {"housing wealth": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.02972070500254631}, "unemployment": {"score": -0.20000000298023224, "magnitude": 0.20000000298023224, "salience": 0.02972070500254631}, "investment": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.016439972445368767}, "level": {"score": -0.30000001192092896, "magnitude": 0.30000001192092896, "salience": 0.01500252541154623}, "employers": {"score": -0.20000000298023224, "magnitude": 0.20000000298023224, "salience": 0.013846988789737225}, "Housing starts": {"score": -0.20000000298023224, "magnitude": 0.20000000298023224, "salience": 0.013798214495182037}, "Business spending": {"score": -0.20000000298023224, "magnitude": 0.20000000298023224, "salience": 0.012792333960533142}, "growth": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.012712406925857067}, "developments": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.012712406925857067}, "commodities": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.01132173091173172}, "payrolls": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.011239892803132534}, "equipment": {"score": -0.20000000298023224, "magnitude": 0.20000000298023224, "salience": 0.011239892803132534}, "structures": {"score": -0.20000000298023224, "magnitude": 0.20000000298023224, "salience": 0.011239892803132534}, "software": {"score": -0.20000000298023224, "magnitude": 0.20000000298023224, "salience": 0.011239892803132534}, "balance": {"score": -0.20000000298023224, "magnitude": 0.20000000298023224, "salience": 0.011169631965458393}, "recovery": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.009369201958179474}}, "paragraph_count": 5, "word_count": 356, "n_gram_count": {"1": 356, "2": 355, "3": 354}, "pos_tags_count": {"noun_count": 63, "verb_count": 16, "adjective_count": 43}, "change_in_vix": 0.8611007113440674, "change_in_s_n_p_500": -0.3753547560194055}
