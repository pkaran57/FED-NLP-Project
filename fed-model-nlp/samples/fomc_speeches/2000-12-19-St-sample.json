While some inflation risks persist, they are diminished by the more moderate pace of economic activity and by the absence of any indication that longer-term inflation expectations have increased.  The Committee will continue to monitor closely the evolving economic situation.  \r\n", "\r\nAgainst the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee consequently believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.  \r\n", "\n2000 Monetary policy\n"], "doc_type": "St"}, "entity_sentiments": {"drag": {"score": -0.30000001192092896, "magnitude": 0.30000001192092896, "salience": 0.014557941816747189}, "profits": {"score": -0.4000000059604645, "magnitude": 0.4000000059604645, "salience": 0.014557941816747189}, "demand": {"score": -0.4000000059604645, "magnitude": 0.4000000059604645, "salience": 0.014557941816747189}, "markets": {"score": -0.30000001192092896, "magnitude": 0.30000001192092896, "salience": 0.011333748698234558}, "growth": {"score": -0.20000000298023224, "magnitude": 0.20000000298023224, "salience": 0.011333748698234558}, "segments": {"score": -0.30000001192092896, "magnitude": 0.30000001192092896, "salience": 0.00996051263064146}, "earnings": {"score": -0.30000001192092896, "magnitude": 0.30000001192092896, "salience": 0.00983918085694313}, "energy costs": {"score": -0.20000000298023224, "magnitude": 0.20000000298023224, "salience": 0.00983918085694313}, "consumer confidence": {"score": -0.30000001192092896, "magnitude": 0.30000001192092896, "salience": 0.00983918085694313}, "stress": {"score": -0.30000001192092896, "magnitude": 0.30000001192092896, "salience": 0.00983918085694313}, "sales": {"score": -0.30000001192092896, "magnitude": 0.30000001192092896, "salience": 0.00983918085694313}, "shortfalls": {"score": -0.4000000059604645, "magnitude": 0.4000000059604645, "salience": 0.00983918085694313}, "reports": {"score": -0.30000001192092896, "magnitude": 0.30000001192092896, "salience": 0.00983918085694313}, "indication": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.009096130728721619}}, "paragraph_count": 4, "word_count": 154, "n_gram_count": {"1": 154, "2": 153, "3": 152}, "pos_tags_count": {"noun_count": 29, "verb_count": 5, "adjective_count": 18}, "change_in_vix": null, "change_in_s_n_p_500": null}
