Output \r\n        appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the earlier rise in energy \r\n        prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Inflation \r\n        and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.\r\n      ", " The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment \r\n        of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters \r\n        to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively \r\n        low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at \r\n        a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will \r\n        respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation \r\n        to maintain price stability.\r\n      ", " Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, Chairman; \r\n        Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger \r\n        W. Ferguson, Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; \r\n        Cathy E. Minehan; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.\r\n      ", " In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25 \r\n        basis point \r\n        increase in the discount rate to 3-1/4 percent. In taking this action, \r\n        the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of \r\n        the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, \r\n        Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, \r\n        and San Francisco.\r\n      ", " In addition, the Committee unanimously decided to expedite the release \r\n        of its minutes. Beginning with this meeting, the minutes of regularly \r\n        scheduled meetings will be released three weeks after the date of the \r\n        policy decision. The first set of expedited minutes will be released at \r\n        2 p.m. EST on January 4, 2005.\n", "\n\n2004 Monetary policy\n"], "doc_type": "St"}
