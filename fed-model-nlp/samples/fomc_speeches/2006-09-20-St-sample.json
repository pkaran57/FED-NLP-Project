However, inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices, contained inflation expectations, and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand.", "Nonetheless, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.", "Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Susan S. Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against was Jeffrey M. Lacker, who preferred an increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate target at this meeting."], "doc_type": "St"}, "entity_sentiments": {"growth": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.04919881001114845}, "housing market": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.01877412386238575}, "cooling": {"score": 0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.016499752178788185}, "monetary policy actions": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.012730540707707405}, "effects": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.011185702867805958}, "inflation expectations": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.011185702867805958}, "factors": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.011185702867805958}, "impetus": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.011049240827560425}, "aggregate demand": {"score": -0.10000000149011612, "magnitude": 0.10000000149011612, "salience": 0.008537597954273224}}, "paragraph_count": 5, "word_count": 205, "n_gram_count": {"1": 205, "2": 204, "3": 203}, "pos_tags_count": {"noun_count": 39, "verb_count": 7, "adjective_count": 15}, "change_in_vix": null, "change_in_s_n_p_500": 0.19621160667118775}
